# Vex-Automatic-Marble-Sorting-Robot
I originally developed this automatic sorting robot in compliance with the PLTW 3.3 Materials Sorter guidelines. I built this marble sorting machine from the VEX EDR platform guided by the VEX EDR Cortex Microcontroller computer. The criteria for this project is for the machine to automatically separate three different colors of three marbles made of different materials (wood, clear acrylic, and steel).Â
